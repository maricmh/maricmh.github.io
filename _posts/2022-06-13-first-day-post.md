Hello Again!  


During this first day, we were first briefed on saftey precautions, how to use the Epilog Laser Mini (laser cutter), and how to create a website.  

Being introduced to the machine was reaaly cool and interesting. Being taught how to function it, what appliances to turn on such as the BOFA fume extractor and  

the DOA-P725-BN to safely use the laser cutter. Our first usage for it was to cut holes in the acrylic, then to engrave and cut the paper for the lightbox project.  

After using the machine for about an hour, we started on our website making! The website making was interesting, but challenging as the instructions on the website   

we was told to follow was quite complicated for a greenhorn, such as me. In the process of making the website we used these applications: Github, Gitbash, and Visual Studio Code  

Doing this until 4.40 was extremely exhausting as i felt I used all my brain juices, as if all the life got sucked out of me. I had to redo mine after 5 hours of hardwork as  

there were some technical problems and I was not able to finish it today.  

Though it ended up like that, it was quite the experience to go through. Excitement, confusion and dissapointment. However I had alot of takes on this.  

I've learnt that to create instructions, we have to have a clear way of portraying what we want to say. To articulate our thoughts in a clear and precise manner.  

Either than that, I have also learnt to not give up halfway and persevere even if I am not good in that particular section.     



Though today may be a little dissapointing, I really look forward to my second day at DFS. ;D
