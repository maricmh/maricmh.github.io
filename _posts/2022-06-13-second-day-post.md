Hey!  


Today is my second day at DFS!   

After continuing on our website making for about 15 min, I was introduced to Gather Town! Gather Town is an interactive virtual platfrom which lets you video call  

people in a terrain. You can even make your own terrain! After exploring and looking at what function there were in Gather Town, I created a powerpoint slide on it,  

showing instructions on different function in Gather Town. Creating the ppt slides was really thareputic compared to the strenuous process of making our own websites.  

Regarding the making of slides, i was able to finish it today! This whole day was really fuffiling.  

Looking forward to the next day @ Science Centre DFS!
